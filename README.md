# Payroll Management System

This **Payroll Management System** is a lightweight, browser-based application designed to manage payroll details for various types of employersâ€”such as **water management workers, electricians, carpenters, and plumbers**.

Built entirely with **Core TypeScript**, **HTML**, and **CSS**, the system emphasizes strong **object-oriented programming (OOP)** principles without relying on any frontend frameworks like React. The project demonstrates how powerful and scalable applications can be created using only the core web technologies and TypeScript's static typing features.
